# data-modeling-with-postgreSQL

The README file you attached is empty hence please add the details of the project to the README. You can talk about the database and schema design (Fact and Dimension Tables), ETL process, CONFLICT statements if any etc. You can also add screenshots of the final table if you need to add more information to the README.
Additionally, you can also talk about how to run the python scripts and what each file represents in the repository.


## Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## How to run the python script
- open up your terminal
- run python create_tables.py
- run python etl.py
