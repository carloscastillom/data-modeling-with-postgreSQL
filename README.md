# data-modeling-with-postgreSQL

The README file you attached is empty hence please add the details of the project to the README. You can talk about the database and schema design (Fact and Dimension Tables), ETL process, CONFLICT statements if any etc. You can also add screenshots of the final table if you need to add more information to the README.
Additionally, you can also talk about how to run the python scripts and what each file represents in the repository.
